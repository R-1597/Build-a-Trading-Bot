# Build-a-Trading-Bot
This project is a complete no-code trading bot execution platform, inspired by visual workflow tools like N8N, but designed specifically for algorithmic trading. Users can create custom trading strategies by visually connecting nodes—such as market data fetchers, indicators, conditions, and order execution blocks—without writing any code.
